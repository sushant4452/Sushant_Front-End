    There are a few problems with the code:

    The setSelectedIndex function is being called incorrectly in the List component. It should be invoked as setSelectedIndex(null) instead of using an assignment operator.
    The isSelected prop passed to SingleListItem should be a boolean value, but it is currently set to selectedIndex, which is a state variable.
    This will cause the background color of all list items to be green when an item is selected, rather than just the selected item.

    
    The propTypes definition for items in WrappedListComponent is incorrect. It should be PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({...})), not PropTypes.array(PropTypes.shape({...})).
    The defaultProps for items in WrappedListComponent should be an empty array ([]), not null.
